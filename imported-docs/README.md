# Welcome


Welcome to the immudb documentation. Great to see you here!

immudb is a database written in Go, but unlike other databases, it is immutable: history is preserved and can't be changed without clients noticing.

immudb can be used both as a key-value store, or as a relational database (SQL).

immudb can be run as full database server with replicas or easily embedded as a lightweight database into application.
